Hello ^.^

This is my book blog.

It originally started as a Github page mini repo, but I eventually bought a dedicated domain for [it](https://www.thereadingcorner.net).

It spans over 5 years at this point!

In terms of code, it's relatively simple.

Todos
- [ ] Add SSR to unlock post previews
- [ ] Add a total page visitor counter

It's hosted on AWS using a S3 bucket and two Cloudfront instances. I deploy by running the deploy.py script.
